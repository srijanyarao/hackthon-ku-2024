# Sign Savy

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for:

Sign Language is a unique form of communication primarily used by individuals who are hard of hearing or deaf. It enables people to convey ideas and thoughts through gestures, overcoming the barriers caused by hearing difficulties. However, a significant challenge with Sign Language is the limited knowledge of the language among the general population. Learning Sign Language requires considerable time and effort, which discourages many from acquiring it.

Sign language recognition software leverages computer vision and machine learning technologies to accurately interpret signs. This innovative technology can be integrated into smartphones, tablets, and computers, allowing Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to communicate effortlessly with those who can hear.






## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop sign language recognition software using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a tool that enables seamless communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not, thereby promoting inclusivity and accessibility.
## Features

- Real-time recognition of sign language gestures
- Accurate interpretation of a wide range of signs.
- User-friendly interface for easy communication.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


## Challenges

1: Detecting sign language gestures in real time posed challenges with variations in lighting, backgrounds etc.

2: Our model cannot predict some signs accurately due to a large similarity between them.
